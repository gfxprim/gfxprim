Coding Style
------------

This document defines coding style for GFXprim.

C Coding Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GFXprim is written in C. There is no C++ code in and I mean it. A few headers
do contain '#ifndef __cplusplus' so that you can interface GFXprim headers as
'extern C' without problems. If this doesn't work, let us know.

GFXprim follows mostly Linux Kernel coding style, see
'Documentation/CodingStyle' in the Linux Kernel source or follow this
link:http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle[link] (it's funny and
enligthening reading).

.Indentation and whitespaces

* We use tabs for indentation and tab is eight spaces wide.

* Lines should be at most 80 chars long.

* No additional whitespaces (other than newline) at the end of line.

* Each file must end with newline (most editors do that automatically, beware
  of Kate).

.Braces and Spaces

* Avoid tricky expressions if possible ;)

* Do not put multiple statements on a single line.
+
[source,c]
----
/* WRONG */
if (something) do_work();
	do_other();

/* RIGHT */
if (something)
	do_work();

do_other();
----

* Each block that has more than one line should be enclosed in
  curly braces.
+
Also if one part of if then else is enclosed in
curly braces the other one should be enclosed too.
+
[source,c]
----
/* WRONG */
if (something)
	do_other_thing();
	else if (something_else)
		do_thing();
	else
		return;

/* RIGHT */
if (something) {
	do_other_thing();
} else {
	if (something_else)
		do_thing();
	else
		return;
}
----

* On the other hand do not use braces unnecesarily.
+
[source,c]
----
/* WRONG */
if (something) {
	do_work();
}

/* RIGHT */
if (something)
	do_work();
----

* The preffered way of writing switch is as follows:
+
[source,c]
----
switch (var) {
case XYZ:
	do_something():
break;
case ABC:
	return 1;
default:
break;
}
----

TIP: You can use Linux Kernel 'scripts/checkpatch.pl' to check your code.

GFXprim Specific Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Library external API uses CamelCase
** Together with mandatory 'GP_' prefix.
** For example 'GP_PixelType', 'GP_Context', etc.
** We will not change that, get over it. (It could have been worse, trust me.)

* Basic library types are typedefed
** We have 'GP_Size' and 'GP_Coord' integer types to better distinguish
   roles of function parameters.
** The basic structures are also typedefed so you can wite 'GP_Context'
   instead of 'struct GP_Context'.
** Other uses of typedef are frowned upon.

* When you add an externally visible symbol, i.e. new API function
  please add its name into the corresponding file at 'build/syms/'. You may
  also run the 'buld/check_symbols.sh' script to check that you haven't
  accidentally exposed intenal only interfaces.

Python Coding Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python parts of GFXprim follow mostly coding style outlined in
link:http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/[PEP 8].
The major difference is that the default indent is 2 spaces.
All files should be ASCII unless required otherwise.

GFXPrim uses CamelCase as described in the C section.
The names are mostly derived from the corresponding C names without
the 'GP_' prefix.
All wrapped symbols of a module are available in the SWIG modules 'foo.c_foo'
(i.e. 'core.c_core').

Some number and enum types are typedeffed in C, but left as integers
in the Python interface.
All constants are available in 'foo.C' submodules (i.e. 'core.C')
to avoid clutter.

Where this makes sense, functions should be available as methods of
an object (i.e. 'Context.Copy()' rather than 'Copy(context)'). Be Pythonic.
