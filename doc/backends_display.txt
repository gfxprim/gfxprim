Hardware display backends
-------------------------

Hardware display backends support various displays connected to hardware
link:backends_gpio.html[GPIO] e.g. SPI e-ink RPi Hat. These displays are
coupled with Linux input driver so that you can get a computer with a
keyboard, mouse and display just by connecting display to
link:backends_gpio.html[GPIOs] as well as USB keyboard and/or mouse.

In order to start an application with a hardware display backend
'display:$display_name' string has to be passed to the display init function.
This is usually done on a commandline by passing the '-b' option.

IMPORTANT: In order to run display backends as a regular user the user has
           to be in the right groups that is 'gpio' and for SPI displays 'spi'
	   group as well.

E-ink displays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

E-ink displays repaint is slow, especially the large ones, the refresh can
take up to a few seconds. In order to make such displays usable with an
interactive work e-ink display backends implements asynchronous mode. That
means that during the display refresh the areas that were requested to be
repainted by the application are merged and once the display is ready the
merged area is refreshed on the display. With this even terminal emulator
is quite usable on e-ink displays.

E-ink displays that support partial refresh have to do a full refresh once in
a while in order to get rid of noise/artifacts/ghosts that is added by doing
several partial refreshes in a row. The e-ink display layer keeps track of
partial refreshes and schedulles full refresh when needed so that this is
transparent to the application.

SPI displays
~~~~~~~~~~~~

SPI displays need 'spidev' userspace SPI driver and a few GPIOs for additional
signaling. The default RPi GPIO mapping is compatible with WaveShare e-ink
display hats.

IMPORTANT: SPI displays require 'spidev' (userspace SPI interface) driver that
           is bind to the hardware SPI driver. On RPi this is done by
	   'raspi-config' where you enable SPI and reboot. After the reboot the
	   /dev/spidev0.0 should be available.
